# CoastSat

CoastSat is an open-source software toolkit written in Python that enables users to obtain time-series of shoreline position at any coastline worldwide from 30+ years (and growing) of publicly available satellite imagery.

Visit the [CoastSat website](http://coastsat.wrl.unsw.edu.au/) to explore and download regional-scale datasets of satellite-derived shorelines and beach slopes.
